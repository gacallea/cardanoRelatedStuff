Hereby you find my first humble contribution to the [Cardano](https://www.cardano.org/en/home/) ecosystem. I hope that they can be helpful to you. Enjoy :)

## Not Another Cardano Guide ##

```Not Another Cardano Guide``` is a guide that will help you setup a pool with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You can [**find it here**](https://guides.insalada.io/#/NACG).

## Pool Operator Helper Scripts ##

```jor_wrapper``` and ```node_helpers``` are a set of ```bash``` scripts to help pool operators manage their nodes. These spun off [Chris G ```.bash_profile```](https://github.com/Chris-Graffagnino/Jormungandr-for-Newbs/blob/master/config/.bash_profile). I have *ported them to bash (scripts)*, improved some of the commands, adapted others to the ```NACG``` guide setup, and implemented brand new features. You will still be able to use ```jor_wrapper``` and the ```node_helpers``` scripts, regardless of the guide you used to set up your pool.

Head over to the [**scripts page**](SCRIPTS.md) to learn about ```jor_wrapper``` and the ```node_helpers```. In there, you will also find suggested server management commands and tools, examples, teaser screenshots, and more resources.

Last but not least, should you need help at any stage of your pool operator journey, join the '[Cardano Shelley Testnet & StakePool Best Practice Workgroup](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup)' group on Telegram; it is packed with knowledge, and great and helpful people.

## About Me ###

Should you be wondering about my technical background, [I've been a Linux professional](https://linkedin.com/in/gacallea/) for a long time. I love Open Source, and I've taught people about it. I strongly believe in Cardano. And it was a long time since I last contributed to a project.

I also run the [**Insalada Stake Pool**](https://insalada.io/), and this is what got me into this adventure. Follow [**insaladaPool**](https://twitter.com/insaladaPool)  on Twitter for future updates.

## Contributions ##

If you have comments, changes, suggestions for the guide and/or the scripts, please [file an issue](https://github.com/gacallea/cardanoRelatedStuff/issues) on Github. Any insight is valuable and will be considered for integration and improvements.

If these resources help you in any way, consider [buying me a beer](https://seiza.com/blockchain/address/Ae2tdPwUPEZHwvuNhu7qGeBcZBTQAwL2SUA49T6CubbQzoxgxyffYJ8VvcW). Delegating [to my pool](https://insalada.io/) would also be nice. It'd be awesome if [INSL](https://pooltool.io/pool/93756c507946c4d33d582a2182e6776918233fd622193d4875e96dd5795a348c) started crunching numbers besides server bills.
